# Beijing Air Quality Predictor

This project uses a deep learning model based on LSTM neural networks to predict short-term PM2.5 air pollution levels in Beijing. By analyzing historical air quality and weather data, the model captures Beijing‚Äôs complex pollution dynamics‚Äîshaped by weather, traffic, and seasonal heating‚Äîachieving a validation RMSE of **46.8831 Œºg/m¬≥**.

## Overview

Air pollution is a major health hazard in cities like Beijing, where PM2.5 levels can rise unpredictably. This project presents a robust forecasting system powered by a multi-layer LSTM model that learns from patterns in air quality and weather data. The model is accurate enough to support real-world air quality alerts, and its performance is demonstrated through visualizations in Jupyter notebooks.

## Technical Overview

### Data Processing

* **Loading:** Standardizes columns, converts timestamps, sets datetime index.
* **Cleaning:** Uses time-based interpolation and mean imputation.
* **Sequences:** Creates 72-hour sliding windows for temporal context.
* **Scaling:** Applies MinMaxScaler to normalize data.

### Model Architecture

```python
Sequential([
    LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, kernel_regularizer=l2(0.001)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.4),
    LSTM(64, return_sequences=True, kernel_regularizer=l2(0.001)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.4),
    LSTM(32, return_sequences=False, kernel_regularizer=l2(0.001)),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.4),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(1)
])
```

#### Why It Works

* **Stacked LSTMs:** Capture short- and long-term trends.
* **Regularization:** Prevents overfitting with dropout and L2.
* **Batch Norm:** Stabilizes and accelerates training.
* **Adam Optimizer:** Uses a learning rate of 0.0005 for smooth convergence.

### Training Setup

* **Lookback Window:** 72 hours
* **Validation Split:** 20%
* **Early Stopping:** Patience of 10 epochs
* **Learning Rate Scheduler:** Halves rate after 5 stagnant epochs
* **Batch Size:** 64 (adjustable)
